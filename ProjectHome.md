This project is for sharing code and other resources that can be used with the [ICWSM Datasets](http://www.icwsm.org/2009/data/).

If you have some code you would like to share, let us know and we will provide a link here and on the Google Group page.  If you would like to host some source code here so that others can modify it and then share it for everyone, we can do that too.

The license on the project is "BSD" just for maximum flexibility.  If you have code and you want it licensed another way, that's fine as long as it's one of the Google Code licenses.

If you create a useful extract of the data, for example a search index, we'd love to link to that too.
